## 🚀 **Summary of Progress**

- **CPPI Strategy Testing**
  - Set up a robust, modular notebook to test the CPPI (Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance) strategy using SPY (risky asset) and TLT (safe asset) data from yfinance.
- **Performance Analytics**
  - Integrated the `performance_summary` function for clear, side-by-side comparison of CPPI vs. SPY buy & hold, with all metrics displaying correctly after aligning data frequencies.
- **Interactive Visualization**
  - Implemented interactive widgets to adjust CPPI parameters (multiplier, floor, rebalancing frequency) and instantly visualize performance and portfolio growth.
- **Debugging & Learning**
  - Diagnosed and resolved issues related to data alignment, rebalancing frequency, and pandas index mismatches. Gained a deeper understanding of how to handle time series data for strategy evaluation.

## 🛠️ **Key Achievements**

- Downloaded and prepared daily SPY and TLT data, handling yfinance’s MultiIndex columns.
- Built a bulletproof CPPI function supporting flexible rebalancing, transaction costs, and logging.
- Ensured all performance metrics (returns, volatility, Sharpe, drawdown, etc.) are valid and meaningful for both daily and weekly rebalancing.
- Created a clean, interactive notebook template for future strategy testing and documentation.

## ⚠️ **Blockers & Issues**

- Encountered repeated issues with index alignment and frequency mismatches when comparing CPPI and SPY returns, especially with non-daily rebalancing.
- Initial attempts at performance analysis returned zeros or N/A due to empty or misaligned Series.
- Resolved by resampling benchmark returns to match the CPPI strategy’s frequency and aligning both Series before analysis.

## 📈 **Next Steps**

- Extend the notebook to test additional strategies (e.g., value investing, momentum, ML-based allocation).
- Add more advanced analytics (e.g., rolling statistics, drawdown plots, risk attribution).
- Begin integrating financial statement analysis and news-based signals as planned.
- Continue refining the documentation and codebase for clarity and reproducibility.
