Daily Log – July 5, 2025
Summary of Progress
CPPI Strategy Testing:
Successfully set up a robust, modular notebook to test the CPPI (Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance) strategy using SPY (risky asset) and TLT (safe asset) data from yfinance.

Performance Analytics:
Integrated the performance_summary function for clear, side-by-side comparison of CPPI vs. SPY buy & hold, with all metrics displaying correctly after aligning data frequencies.

Interactive Visualization:
Implemented interactive widgets to adjust CPPI parameters (multiplier, floor, rebalancing frequency) and instantly visualize performance and portfolio growth.

Debugging & Learning:
Diagnosed and resolved issues related to data alignment, rebalancing frequency, and pandas index mismatches. Gained a deeper understanding of how to handle time series data for strategy evaluation.

Key Code/Workflow Achievements
Downloaded and prepared daily SPY and TLT data, handling yfinance’s MultiIndex columns.

Built a bulletproof CPPI function supporting flexible rebalancing, transaction costs, and logging.

Ensured all performance metrics (returns, volatility, Sharpe, drawdown, etc.) are valid and meaningful for both daily and weekly rebalancing.

Created a clean, interactive notebook template for future strategy testing and documentation.

Blockers & Issues
Encountered repeated issues with index alignment and frequency mismatches when comparing CPPI and SPY returns, especially with non-daily rebalancing.

Initial attempts at performance analysis returned zeros or N/A due to empty or misaligned Series.

Resolved by resampling benchmark returns to match the CPPI strategy’s frequency and aligning both Series before analysis.

Next Steps
Extend the notebook to test additional strategies (e.g., value investing, momentum, ML-based allocation).

Add more advanced analytics (e.g., rolling statistics, drawdown plots, risk attribution).

Begin integrating financial statement analysis and news-based signals as planned.

Continue refining the documentation and codebase for clarity and reproducibility.
