# Daily Recap — July 3, 2025

## Progress

- **Environment Reset & Setup**
  - Fully reset the `trading-bot` conda environment and reinstalled all required Python packages (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, statsmodels, yfinance, ta, ipywidgets, jupyterlab).
  - Verified correct environment activation and successful imports in Jupyter notebooks.

- **CPPI Module & Notebook**
  - Fixed data download issues for SPY and TLT by updating the data acquisition cell to use robust yfinance calls.
  - Understood that the 2022–2023 backtest window showed drawdowns due to simultaneous equity and bond declines.
  - Extended the backtest window to observe CPPI’s behavior during market rebounds.
  - Implemented and tested the interactive CPPI simulation with ipywidgets sliders for `floor_pct` and `multiplier`.
  - Created a clear, well-structured user guide for the CPPI notebook and strategy.

- **Documentation & Project Structure**
  - Established a professional project structure with `notebooks/`, `strategies/`, `docs/`, and other key folders.
  - Added a detailed CPPI user guide in `docs/CPPI_User_Guide.md`.
  - Began maintaining daily progress logs in the `docs/` folder.

- **Version Control**
  - Created a GitHub account and initialized the `algorithmic-trading-bot` repository.
  - Learned and practiced essential git commands: `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`.
  - Set up SSH authentication for seamless, secure git operations.
  - Cleaned up nested `.git` folders to avoid submodule issues.
  - Successfully pushed all project files, documentation, and logs to GitHub.

- **Automation**
  - Installed the PyGithub package in the `trading-bot` environment.
  - Generated and configured a GitHub Personal Access Token for API use.
  - Created a Python script (`upload_daily_log.py`) to automate uploading daily recaps to the GitHub repo.

## Bugs & Blockers

- Initial issues with yfinance data downloads (resolved by using correct parameters and methods).
- Encountered and fixed problems with nested git repositories.
- Resolved authentication issues by switching from HTTPS/password to SSH key authentication.
- Minor hiccups with nano/text editing in the terminal (successfully resolved).

## Next Steps

- Begin development of the asset selection and market regime detection modules.
- Continue documenting daily progress and updating the user guide as new features are added.
- Explore integration of machine learning models and news data feeds for smarter asset allocation.
- Refine the automation script for logs and consider integrating with GitHub Actions for even smoother workflow.
